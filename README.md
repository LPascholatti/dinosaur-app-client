# Dinosaur API - Client 

## Client Developed for a Dinosaur API coded using Django and Django Rest Framework. 

### Technologies: React/Redux/Material UI

This client has been created using ```create react app```. 

This app uses Redux for controlling the states. It uses some elements of material UI for the style, like buttons and a nav bar. 

### Components

Apart from an educational home page, this app allows you to filter a list of dinosaurs by their geological age. It also allows you to send post requests to the API, creating new dinosaurs.

### Development

Implement authorization and authentication coming from the backend to this frontend. 

### Hackathon

Developed during 2.5 days for a Hackathon at Codaisseur in Amsterdam in November, 2019.
