# Dinosaur API - Client 

## Client Developed for a Dinosaur API coded using Django and Django Rest Framework. 

This client has been created using ```create react app```. Apart from an educational home page, this app allows you to filter a list of dinosaurs by their geological age. It uses some elements of material UI for the style, like buttons and a nav bar. 

This app uses Redux for controlling the states.
